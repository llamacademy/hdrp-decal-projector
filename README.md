# HDRP Decal Projection

Many of us who aren't super comfortable writing our own shaders relied on 3rd party tools for decal projections or went with simple quads for decals. HDRP provides us a powerful and flexible tool out of the box to work with for projecting decals onto all kinds of surfaces.

In this tutorial I'll show how to enable decals in HDRP, review all the configuration options in the render asset and what they do, and go over what all the decal projector options do. With this you should have an informed starting point for adding decals into your game!
